# LIPO: Lipschitz Optimization

Implementation of the _LIPO_ algorithm
[(_Global optimization of Lipschitz functions_,
Malherbe et al. 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02628)
defined on a measurable space with a metric. The algorithm samples from an arbitrary
probability measure on the set of potential maximizers of the function at each iteration.
It is defined as a special case of the `Decision` algorithm.

## Main definitions

* `potential_max`: The set of potential maximizers for the LIPO algorithm.
* `LIPO`: The LIPO algorithm that samples from the set of potential maximizers using a given
  probability measure at each iteration.

/-- The set of potential maximizers for the LIPO algorithm.
Given observed data points and function values, this set contains all points `x` where
the maximum observed value is at most the minimum Lipschitz upper bound across all observations.
The upper bound at `x` from observation `i` is `f(xᵢ) + κ · d(xᵢ, x)`, where `κ` is the
Lipschitz constant. -/

/-- The LIPO (LIPschitz Optimization) algorithm for global optimization.
This algorithm optimizes an unknown function assuming only that it has a finite Lipschitz
constant `κ`. It starts with an arbitrary probability measure `μ` as initial distribution and
iteratively samples from the set of potential maximizers, ensuring consistency and convergence to
the global optimum [(Malherbe et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02628). -/
